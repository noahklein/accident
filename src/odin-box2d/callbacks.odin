package box2d

// Prototype for a pre-solve callback.
//
// This is called after a contact is updated. This allows you to inspect a
// contact before it goes to the solver. If you are careful, you can modify the
// contact manifold (e.g. disable contact).
//
// Notes:
// - this function must be thread-safe
// - this is only called if the shape has enabled presolve events
// - this is called only for awake dynamic bodies
// - this is not called for sensors
// - the supplied manifold has impulse values from the previous step
// - Return false if you want to disable the contact this step
Pre_Solve_Fcn :: #type proc "c" (shape_id_a, shape_id_b: Shape_ID, manifold: ^Manifold, context_: rawptr) -> bool

// Prototype callback for AABB queries.
//
// See world_query
//
// Called for each shape found in the query AABB.
// * Return false to terminate the query.
Query_Result_Fcn :: #type proc "c" (shape_id: Shape_ID, context_: rawptr) -> bool

// Callback class for ray casts.
//
// See world_ray_cast
//
// Called for each shape found in the query. You control how the ray cast
// proceeds by returning a float:
// * return -1: ignore this shape and continue
// * return 0: terminate the ray cast
// * return fraction: clip the ray to this point
// * return 1: don't clip the ray and continue
// * param shape the shape hit by the ray
// * param point the point of initial intersection
// * param normal the normal vector at the point of intersection
// * param fraction the fraction along the ray at the point of intersection
// * return -1 to filter, 0 to terminate, fraction to clip the ray for
// * closest hit, 1 to continue

Joint_Destroyed_Fcn :: #type proc "c" (joint_id: Joint_ID, context_: rawptr)
Shape_Destroyed_Fcn :: #type proc "c" (shape_id: Shape_ID, context_: rawptr)

// Implement this class to provide collision filtering. In other words, you can implement
// this class if you want finer control over contact creation.
// Return true if contact calculations should be performed between these two shapes.
// @warning for performance reasons this is only called when the AABBs begin to overlap.
Should_Collide_Fcn :: #type proc "c" (shape_id_a, shape_id_b: Shape_ID, context_: rawptr) -> bool

// Implement these callbacks to get contact information. You can use these results for
// things like sounds and game logic. You can also get contact results by
// traversing the contact lists after the time step. However, you might miss
// some contacts because continuous physics leads to sub-stepping.
// Additionally you may receive multiple callbacks for the same contact in a
// single time step.
// You should strive to make your callbacks efficient because there may be
// many callbacks per time step.
// @warning You cannot create/destroy Box2D entities inside these callbacks.
// Called when two shapes begin to touch.

// Called when two shapes cease to touch.
End_Contact_Fcn :: #type proc "c" (shape_id_a, shape_id_b: Shape_ID, context_: rawptr)


// This lets you inspect a contact after the solver is finished. This is useful
// for inspecting impulses.
// Note: the contact manifold does not include time of impact impulses, which can be
// arbitrarily large if the sub-step is small. Hence the impulse is provided explicitly
// in a separate data structure.
// Note: this is only called for contacts that are touching, solid, and awake.
