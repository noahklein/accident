// This is used to fatten AABBs in the dynamic tree. This allows proxies
// to move by a small amount without triggering a tree adjustment.
//
// This is in meters.
// * Warning modifying this can have a significant impact on performance
AABB_MARGIN :: 0.1 * LENGTH_UNITS_PER_METER

// A small length used as a collision and constraint tolerance. Usually it is
// chosen to be numerically significant, but visually insignificant. In meters.
// @warning modifying this can have a significant impact on stability
LINEAR_SLOP :: 0.005 * LENGTH_UNITS_PER_METER

// A small angle used as a collision and constraint tolerance. Usually it is
// chosen to be numerically significant, but visually insignificant.
// * Warning modifying this can have a significant impact on stability
ANGULAR_SLOP :: 2 / 180 * PI

// The maximum number of vertices on a convex polygon. Changing this affects performance even if you
// don't use more vertices.

// Maximum number of simultaneous worlds that can be allocated

// The maximum linear translation of a body per step. This limit is very large and is used
// to prevent numerical problems. You shouldn't need to adjust this. Meters.

// The time that a body must be still before it will go to sleep. In seconds.
TIME_TO_SLEEP :: #config(BOX2D_TIME_TO_SLEEP, 0.5)

// Used to detect bad values. Positions greater than about 16km will have precision
